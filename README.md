# 4D-Game
A simple Euclidean 4D FPS Game

There isn't much in the way of an actual game here yet, but the idea for me at least is to be able to mess with four dimensional space as a game mechanic. I am doing so that I could move on to another game and utilize similar mechanics.

It is though intended to become a room-based first person shooter. Because of this I am working on making 4D walls. The geometry of these walls is exactly the same as the geometry for a 3D cube, and I do keep calling it a cube, but it is a wall.

There are many methods to displaying a 4D space on a 2D screen, but the one I had begun to use is to just display whatever goes through a 3D slice of this 4D space.

Controls
--------

* W/S/A/D/E/Q - move forwards/backwards/left/right/ana/kata
* I/K/L/J/O/U - rotate on the planes forward-up/forward-right/forward-ana

Notes
-----

* Uses SDL2 only
